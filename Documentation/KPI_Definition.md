# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To track and measure the impact of continuous improvement initiatives, the following **KPIs** were established. These metrics focus on **efficiency, quality, and maintenance** to ensure sustained progress.

## ðŸ“Š **Production KPIs**
- **Line Downtime (minutes/day)** â†’ Measures total unproductive time due to stoppages.
- **Changeover Time (minutes per batch)** â†’ Tracks efficiency of product transitions.
- **Operator Utilization (%)** â†’ Assesses workforce efficiency in production tasks.
- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE, %)** â†’ Combines availability, performance, and quality to evaluate machine efficiency.

## ðŸ”§ **Maintenance KPIs**
- **Unplanned Downtime (minutes/week)** â†’ Tracks equipment failures affecting production.
- **Preventive vs. Corrective Maintenance Ratio** â†’ Ensures proactive maintenance.
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF, hours)** â†’ Measures reliability of machinery.
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR, hours)** â†’ Evaluates efficiency of maintenance response.

## âœ… **Quality KPIs**
- **Defect Rate (% per batch)** â†’ Tracks product consistency and rejects.
- **Material Waste (% per shift)** â†’ Measures losses due to inefficiencies.
- **Compliance with Food Safety Standards (%)** â†’ Ensures adherence to quality protocols.

### ðŸ”„ **KPI Tracking & Continuous Improvement**
All KPIs were monitored over time to assess progress and make **data-driven decisions**. Improvements were prioritized based on **impact on efficiency and cost savings**.

These metrics provided clear visibility into the projectâ€™s effectiveness and guided future optimization efforts.

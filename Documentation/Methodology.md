# Continuous Improvement Methodology

This project followed the **DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) framework**, supported by **Lean, TPM, and JIT** methodologies, to optimize production processes and enhance efficiency in a food manufacturing environment.

## Key Methodologies Used

### 1️⃣ **DMAIC Approach** (Core Framework)
A structured **data-driven approach** to process improvement:
- **Define** → Identified key inefficiencies in production, maintenance, and quality.
- **Measure** → Collected **daily/hourly production and downtime data** in Excel.
- **Analyze** → Used **Pareto analysis and process flow mapping** to pinpoint major bottlenecks.
- **Improve** → Implemented targeted solutions like workforce restructuring and preventive maintenance.
- **Control** → Established **KPIs** to track progress and sustain improvements.

### 2️⃣ **Lean Manufacturing**
Focused on **eliminating waste** and improving workflow by reducing downtime and optimizing workstations.

### 3️⃣ **Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)**
Ensured **proactive equipment management** to prevent failures and minimize unplanned stops.

### 4️⃣ **Just-In-Time (JIT)**
Optimized **supply chain efficiency** by reducing inventory waste and balancing production flow.

### 5️⃣ **Agile Project Management**
An **iterative improvement approach**, using backlog management to track and prioritize actions.

## Methodology Integration
By combining **DMAIC with Lean, TPM, and JIT**, the project ensured a **structured, data-driven decision-making process** to improve efficiency.

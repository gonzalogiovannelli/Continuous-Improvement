# Continuous Improvement Methodology

This project applies **Lean, TPM, JIT, and Agile** methodologies to optimize production processes and enhance efficiency in a food manufacturing environment.

## Key Methodologies Used

### 1️⃣ Lean Manufacturing
A systematic approach to **eliminating waste** and **improving workflow**. We focused on:
- Reducing downtime caused by inefficient workstations.
- Optimizing process flow to minimize bottlenecks.
- Ensuring a continuous improvement mindset across teams.

### 2️⃣ Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)
A strategy to **prevent downtime** by proactively maintaining equipment. Key actions:
- Implemented preventive maintenance plans to reduce unexpected failures.
- Trained operators to perform routine maintenance and early issue detection.
- Developed an initial framework for **zero unplanned stops**.

### 3️⃣ Just-In-Time (JIT)
A production strategy aimed at **minimizing inventory waste** by balancing supply and demand. Steps taken:
- Improved planning to reduce unnecessary stockpiling.
- Streamlined production scheduling to align with real-time demand.
- Reduced changeover time between product batches.

### 4️⃣ Agile Project Management
We applied Agile principles to **prioritize improvements** effectively. This included:
- Creating a **Product Backlog** with **Epics and User Stories** for structured execution.
- Iterative improvements instead of large, disruptive changes.

## Methodology Integration
Each approach was **tailored to address bottlenecks in production, quality, and maintenance**, ensuring a structured, **data-driven decision-making process**.

More details on **specific actions and improvements** can be found in the backlog and KPI tracking documentation.

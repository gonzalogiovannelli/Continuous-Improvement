# Product Backlog (DMAIC Approach)

## Define Phase
- **[Done]** 🏁 Problem Identification → "As a project team, we need to define key production inefficiencies using data."
- **[Done]** 📊 Data Collection → "As a project team, we need to track production and downtime to identify major bottlenecks."

## Measure Phase
- **[Done]** 📈 Root Cause Analysis → "As a team, we need to determine the top reasons for downtime using Pareto analysis."
- **[Done]** 📌 Process Flow Mapping → "As a process engineer, I want to visualize the production flow to detect inefficiencies."

## Improve Phase
- **[In Progress]** ⏳ Workforce Efficiency → "As a manager, I want to restructure rest breaks to reduce downtime."
- **[To Do]** 🔧 Equipment Reliability → "As an operator, I want a preventive maintenance schedule to minimize failures."
- **[To Do]** ⚙️ Process Optimization → "As a production planner, I want to reduce changeover times between batches."
- **[To Do]** 📋 Standardized Workflows → "As a supervisor, I want clear procedures to ensure consistency."

## Control Phase
- **[In Progress]** 📊 KPI Tracking → "As a project lead, I want to track KPIs to measure the impact of improvements."
- **[To Do]** 📚 Documentation & Training → "As a quality manager, I want training materials to ensure long-term adherence to improvements."

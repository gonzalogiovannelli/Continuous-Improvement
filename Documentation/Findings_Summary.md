# Findings Summary

This section highlights key inefficiencies identified during the **Analyze** phase of the **DMAIC** process. The project began with a **data analysis in Excel**, tracking **daily/hourly production and downtime** to determine major bottlenecks.

## üîç **Key Bottlenecks Identified (Analyze Phase)**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Production Issues**
- **Excessive downtime** due to **workforce inefficiencies and unstructured rest breaks**.
- **Unbalanced workload distribution**, leading to uneven operator utilization.
- **High changeover times**, reducing production flow between product batches.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Equipment & Maintenance Challenges**
- **Frequent unplanned stops** due to equipment malfunctions.
- **Poor preventive maintenance planning**, leading to reactive issue resolution.
- **Inefficient heating system**, causing temperature fluctuations in the production line.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Quality & Process Control Gaps**
- **Extended waiting times for in-process materials**, impacting food safety.
- **Inconsistent ingredient mixing**, leading to variability in product quality.
- **Potential contamination risks** due to hydraulic oil leaks in machinery.

## üìä **Data-Driven Analysis (DMAIC - Measure & Analyze)**
To validate these issues, the following analytical methods were used:
- **Excel Data Analysis** ‚Üí Collected daily/hourly data on production and downtime.
- **Pareto Analysis** ‚Üí Identified the most critical causes of downtime.
- **Process Flow Mapping** ‚Üí Visualized inefficiencies in production sequences.
- **Workforce Utilization Study** ‚Üí Assessed operator workload and time allocation.

The next steps involve implementing targeted solutions under the **Improve** phase.

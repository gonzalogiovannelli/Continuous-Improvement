# Findings Summary

This section highlights the key inefficiencies and bottlenecks identified during the analysis phase. The goal was to pinpoint areas where improvements could have the most significant impact on **production efficiency, quality, and maintenance**.

## üîç Key Bottlenecks Identified

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Production Issues**
- **Excessive downtime** due to **workforce inefficiencies and unstructured rest breaks**.
- **Unbalanced workload distribution**, leading to uneven operator utilization.
- **High changeover times**, reducing production flow between product batches.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Equipment & Maintenance Challenges**
- **Frequent unplanned stops** due to equipment malfunctions.
- **Poor preventive maintenance planning**, leading to reactive issue resolution.
- **Inefficient heating system**, causing temperature fluctuations in the production line.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Quality & Process Control Gaps**
- **Extended waiting times for in-process materials**, impacting food safety.
- **Inconsistent ingredient mixing**, leading to variability in product quality.
- **Potential contamination risks** due to hydraulic oil leaks in machinery.

## üìä Data-Driven Analysis
To validate these issues, the following analytical methods were used:
- **Pareto Analysis** ‚Üí Identified the most critical causes of downtime.
- **Process Flow Mapping** ‚Üí Visualized inefficiencies in production sequences.
- **Workforce Utilization Study** ‚Üí Assessed operator workload and time allocation.

The next steps involve implementing targeted solutions, prioritizing changes based on impact and feasibility.

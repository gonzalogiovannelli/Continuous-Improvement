# 📈 Continuous Improvement in Food Production  

This project focuses on optimizing **production efficiency, reducing downtime, and improving heat transfer** in a food manufacturing environment. Using **DMAIC, Lean, TPM, and JIT principles**, we analyzed bottlenecks, implemented data-driven solutions, and structured an Agile backlog for continuous improvement.  

## 🔍 **Key Areas of Focus**
- **Process Optimization** – Identifying inefficiencies and improving workflow.  
- **Workforce & Scheduling** – Optimizing operator rest periods to minimize downtime.  
- **Heat Transfer Efficiency** – Improving fryer heating performance and reducing energy loss.  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making** – Using historical production data, KPIs, and Pareto analysis.

## ⚠ **Main Downtime Causes (Based on Pareto Analysis)**
1️⃣ **Workforce Rest Periods ("Cuartos")** – Unstructured breaks affecting production continuity.  
2️⃣ **Product Changeovers** – Long transitions between different product batches.  
3️⃣ **Fryer Temperature Variability** – Oil heat fluctuations causing delays and quality issues.

# 📈 Continuous Improvement in Food Production  

This project focuses on optimizing production efficiency, reducing downtime, and improving quality in a food manufacturing environment. Using **DMAIC, Lean, TPM, and JIT principles**, we analyzed bottlenecks, implemented data-driven solutions, and structured an Agile backlog for continuous improvement.  

## 🔍 **Key Areas of Focus**
- **Process Optimization** – Identifying inefficiencies and improving workflow.  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making** – Using historical production data, KPIs, and Pareto analysis.  
- **Project Management Approach** – Applying Agile methodologies to track improvements.

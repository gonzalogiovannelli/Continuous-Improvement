Continuous Improvement in Food Production
This project focuses on optimizing production efficiency, reducing downtime, and improving quality in a food manufacturing environment. Using Lean, TPM, and JIT principles, we analyzed bottlenecks, implemented data-driven solutions, and structured an Agile backlog for continuous improvement.

Key areas:

Process Optimization – Identifying inefficiencies and improving workflow.
Data-Driven Decision Making – Using KPIs and Pareto analysis to guide improvements.
Project Management Approach – Applying Agile methodologies for structured execution.
